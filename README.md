# snowballio

A tiny app for managing debts using the snowball method. Should be easy enough and keep me motivated.

## Desired features:
- adding new debt
- editing old debt amounts
- add installments to existing debts
- remove the debt automatically once it is paid off
- summarize the total debt amounts
- add an average free money amount to distribute into installments
